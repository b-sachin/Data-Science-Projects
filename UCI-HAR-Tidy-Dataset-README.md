<h3>Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project</h3>
<p>This repository is for Getting and Cleaning Data course project. It has the instructions on how to run analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset.

<h3>Dataset</h3>
  <p><b>Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones</b>

<h3>Files</h3>
<ul>
  <li>	<i>CodeBook.md</i> a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data</li>
<li>  	<i>run_analysis.R</i> performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition:</li>
  <ul>
<li>	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.</li>
<li>	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.</li>
<li>	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.</li>
<li>	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.</li>
<li>	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.</li>
  </ul>
<li>	<i>tidy_data.txt</i> is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above</li>
</ul>
